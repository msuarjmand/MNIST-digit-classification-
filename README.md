# MNIST-digit-classification-
The project presents the well-known problem of MNIST handwritten digit classification.

The dataset used in this project is taken from Kaggle.

# Dataset
It is designed to help scientists develop and test machine learning algorithms in pattern recognition and machine learning. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each of which is a grayscale image of size 28x28 pixels.

The MNIST dataset is a collection of 70,000 handwritten digits (0-9), with each image being 28x28 pixels. Here is the dataset information in the specified format:

- Number of Instances: 70,000 images
- Number of Attributes: 784 (28x28 pixels)

Target: Column represents the digit (0-9) corresponding to the handwritten image
Pixel 1-784: Each pixel value (0-255) represents the grayscale intensity of the corresponding pixel in the image.
